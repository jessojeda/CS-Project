# CS-Project
This is our midterm project for CLPS0950.
Our project is composed of 3 parts:
First, we went through the workshop and tutorials for EEGLAB and manipulated tutorial and real raw data based on our learnings from the tutorial.
Second, we created a script that automated preprocessing for any given EEG data without using the graphical interface of EEGLab toolbox.
Third, we created a script that produces a unique color per participant based on their unique EEG data (brainwave pattern).

This repository also contains a video that we created, which explains how to run our code. This was necessary since our input data is contained in a local folder and isn't accessible to outside coders.
